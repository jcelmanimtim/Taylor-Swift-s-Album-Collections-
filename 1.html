<p>There are plenty of websites out there and just like a painting is created by a painter.</p>
<p>A Website is essentially built by web developers and web designers.</p>
<p>The web designers design the theme, layout, images, and decide the color scheme of the website.</p>
<p>In web developers are responsible for the coding and programming aspect of a website.</p>
<p>Learning web development can be very strange if you don't have the right foundation at first.</p>
